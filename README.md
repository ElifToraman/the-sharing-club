# the-sharing-club

Due to the increasing cost of living today, the number of shared houses and living spaces in many countries, especially in the capitals, has increased considerably. The fact that a few strangers who do not know each other share their duties and responsibilities at home and follow them regularly makes their lives much easier. This project was made in order to easily implement this sharing. The main purpose is to manage the distribution of tasks in shared houses and spaces and to make it fun by collecting points to create a competition. Users can create groups or join already created groups. They can delete, edit, and mark as completed tasks they've added within groups. It can also be used for task distribution and follow-up for small workgroups.
